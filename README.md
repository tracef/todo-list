# Todo List App

## User Story

**As a user, I want to be able to:**

* View a list of tasks
* Add new tasks
* Delete existing tasks
* Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
* Switch between dark mode/light mode
* Interact with my list at a later time
* (In the future) Reorder todos

**So that:**

* I can view tasks that I needed to complete at a particular moment in time, track progress, and not worry about forgetting them.

## Tech stack

* React
* TailwindCSS
