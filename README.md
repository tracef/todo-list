# Todo List App

## User Story

**As a user, I want to be able to:**

* View a list of tasks - complete
* Add new tasks - complete
* Delete existing tasks - complete
* Mark tasks as complete/incomplete - complete
* Interact with my list at a later time
* Re-order tasks

**So that:**

* I can view tasks that I needed to complete at a particular moment in time, track progress, and not worry about forgetting them.

## Tech stack (as of now)

* React
* TailwindCSS
